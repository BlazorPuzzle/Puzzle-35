### The Challenge:

This is a Global Server Blazor Web App that writes a string to local storage. The string is saved on the client and sent down in clear text. How can we encrypt the string to protect it from prying eyes?

> :point_up: **NOTE**: Please do not store credit card data on the client, even if it is encrypted. This is just a demo.
